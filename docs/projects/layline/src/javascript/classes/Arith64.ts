/**
 * Abstract class enables you to perform proper 64-bit arithmetic operations.
 * This class is especially useful when you need to perform arithmetic operations on large numbers in Javascript.
 *
 * In JavaScript, numbers are represented using the IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point format, which can accurately represent integers up to a certain limit. This limit is given by Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, which is 2^{53} - 1 or 9007199254740991.
 *
 * When you add two large numbers that exceed this limit, JavaScript can produce an incorrect result due to loss of precision.
 *
 * **Example of Overflow in JavaScript**
 *
 * Let’s add two numbers that are just above the Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER limit:
 *
 * ```js
 * const a = 4503599627370495; // Just below the max safe integer (2^52 - 1)
 * const b = 4503599627370496; // Exactly 2^52, still within the safe range
 *
 * const result = a + b;  // result is 9007199254740992 -> wrong
 * ```
 *
 * Explanation of the Incorrect Result
 *
 * In the example:
 *
 *    •	a is 4503599627370495 and b is 4503599627370496.
 *    •	Both a and b are within the safe integer range (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER is 9007199254740991).
 *    •	However, their sum (a + b) should be 9007199254740991, but JavaScript incorrectly calculates it as 9007199254740992 due to floating-point precision limitations.
 *
 *
 * **Correct Result**
 *
 * To correctly add large numbers in JavaScript, you can use this abstract class Arith64, which can handle numbers up to 64-bit without precision loss:
 *
 * ```js
 * const a = 4503599627370495; // Just below the max safe integer (2^52 - 1)
 * const b = 4503599627370496; // Exactly 2^52, still within the safe range
 *
 * const result = Arith64.add(a, b); // result is 9007199254740991 -> correct
 * ```

     * @example
     * ```js
     * // Example of an addition operation where JavaScript produces an incorrect result:
     * const a = 9007199254740991; // 2^53 - 1, which is the max safe integer

     *

     * const resultArith64 = Arith64.add(a, b); // resultArith64 is: 9007199254741001 (correct result)
     * ```
     *
     * **Explanation:**
     *
     * JavaScript Standard Addition:
     *
     *    •	In this example, a is set to 9007199254740991, which is the maximum safe integer (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) in JavaScript. When you add 10 to a, the correct result should be 9007199254741001.
     *
     *    •	However, JavaScript can’t accurately represent the sum because it exceeds the maximum safe integer. The result is incorrectly rounded to 9007199254741000 due to the limitations of floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript.
     *
     * Arith64 Addition:
     *
     *    •	The Arith64.add(a, b) method handles this situation correctly by performing the addition. Since Arith64 can handle large integers without losing precision, the result is correctly calculated as 9007199254741001.
     *
     * **Summary**
     *
     *    •	JavaScript Addition: When adding 10 to 9007199254740991, JavaScript produces an incorrect result (9007199254741000) due to precision limitations when dealing with numbers near the maximum safe integer.
     *
     *    •	Arith64 Addition: Using Arith64.add(a, b) ensures correct 64-bit addition, resulting in the correct value of 9007199254741001. This example illustrates the importance of using Arith64 for arithmetic operations involving large numbers to avoid precision issues.

     *
     * JavaScript Standard Modulo:
     *
     *    •	The modulo operation a % b is performed on a large number a that is just above the Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. The expected result should be 2 when dividing 9007199254740992 by 10, but JavaScript’s standard modulo operation can produce incorrect results due to precision loss.
     *
     *    •	In this specific case, the result 2 might still be correct, but in cases where a is significantly larger or more complex, precision issues could lead to incorrect results.
     *
     * Arith64 Modulo:
     *
     *    •	The Arith64.mod(a, b) method performs the modulo operation using 64-bit arithmetic, and converts the result back to a regular Number if necessary.

     *
     *    •	However, because a exceeds the maximum safe integer, JavaScript cannot accurately represent 9007199254740992, and it treats it as a floating-point number.

     * **Explanation:**
     *
     * JavaScript Standard XOR:
     *
     *    •	The XOR operation a ^ b is performed on two large numbers. In JavaScript, bitwise operations like XOR are restricted to 32-bit integers. This means only the lower 32 bits of each operand are considered, and the higher bits are ignored, leading to an incorrect result.
     *
     *    •	Specifically, in this example, a is 0x1FFFFFFFFFFFFF (a large 53-bit number), and b is 0xFFFFFFFF (a 32-bit number). When performing a ^ b, JavaScript incorrectly calculates the result as 9007194959776352 instead of the correct 9007194959776256.
     *
     * Arith64 XOR:
     *
     *    •	The Arith64.xor(a, b) method handles this operation correctly by performing the XOR. Since Arith64 can handle all bits of the operands without being limited to 32 bits, the correct result is calculated as 9007194959776256.
     *
     * **Summary**
     *
     *    •	JavaScript XOR: When performing a bitwise XOR on large numbers, JavaScript produces an incorrect result (9007194959776352) due to its 32-bit limitation for bitwise operations.
     *
     *    •	Arith64 XOR: Using Arith64.xor(a, b) ensures the correct 64-bit XOR operation, which accurately handles all bits, producing the correct result of 9007194959776256. This example illustrates the limitations of JavaScript’s native bitwise operations for large numbers and the need for a Arith64-based approach for accurate calculations.
