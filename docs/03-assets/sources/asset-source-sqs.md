# Source SQS

## Purpose

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that makes it easy to decouple and scale microservices, 
distributed systems, and serverless applications. 
Amazon SQS moves data between distributed application components and helps you decouple these components.

This UI helps to define the specific bucket and folder source of an SQS connected endpoint.
