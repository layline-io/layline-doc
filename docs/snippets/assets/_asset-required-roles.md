![](._asset-required-roles_images/3fdedead.png "Required Roles")

In case you are deploying to a Cluster which is running (a) Reactive Engine Nodes which have (b) specific Roles
configured, then you **can** restrict use of this Asset to those Nodes with matching
roles.
If you want this restriction, then enter the names of the `Required Roles` here. Otherwise, leave empty to match all
Nodes (no restriction).
