# Class: Vendor

## What
The Vendor class represents information and methods which are specific to a Vendor.
A Vendor is a logical entity that groups a number of StatusCodes.
Each Vendor has a long name, short name and a number of StatusCodes.
Vendors available in a Project are defined in the "**Resource Status Definition Asset**".

You typically use the Vendor class to access the [StatusCodes](StatusCode.md) for a specific Vendor.
Please check the documentation for the "**Resource Status Definition Asset**" for more information.

## How to use
In your typical Project you usually never have to access vendor information directly.
But if you do, this is how you can access it.

## Properties

### id

> **id**: int

Provides the ID which you have assigned to the Vendor.
ID 1 is reserved for the internal vendor "LAY" (layline.io).
Your own Vendors will have IDs starting from 2.

#### Example

```python
# You can access all defined Vendors via the global statusRegistry object.

vendors = statusRegistry.vendors

# This returns a list of all defined Vendors for the vendor with index 0.
# Index 0 is reserved and pre-filled by internal vendor "LAY" (layline.io).
# You define additional vendors in the "**Resource Status Definition Asset**".

# To return the id for the first Vendor with index 0:

code = statusRegistry.vendors[0].id
# Returns a Vendor object
```

### longName

> **longName**: str

The long name of the Vendor.
This is the name that you have defined in the "**Resource Status Definition Asset**".

### shortName

> **shortName**: str

The short name of the Vendor.
This is the short name that you have defined in the "**Resource Status Definition Asset**".

### statusCodes

> **statusCodes**: List[[StatusCode](StatusCode.md)]

The StatusCodes which are registered for this Vendor.
This is a list of [StatusCode](StatusCode.md) objects that you have defined for this Vendor in the "**Resource Status Definition Asset**".
