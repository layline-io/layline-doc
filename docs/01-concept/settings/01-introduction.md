# Introduction

There are some configurations which are independent of a _Project_. 
This is where the _Settings_ section comes which is where these more global settings can be defined.

### Configuration Server

Settings which change the content of the Configuration Server. Primarily **User Storage** and **Security Storage** Settings.

_User Storage_ defines Users, User Groups and Roles as well as their respective rights to access functionality on the Configuration Server.

_Security Storage_ is the place where things like Private Keys, Identity Certificates, Trust Certificates and Known Hosts, which need to be known to the Configuration Server, are stored.

### Clusters

This section defines Clusters which are known to the Configuration Server.
You can define them [here](settings-cluster.md).

### Application Settings

This is where preferences regarding the Configuration Center are defined.
You can define them [here](settings-application.md).
