### Where next

We recommend three options on where you can continue the journey:

1. To get to know layline.io better, continue to [What is layline.io?](../concept/introduction) and subsequent chapters.
2. Work through a sample: You can work through the [Sample Kafka](https://layline.io/blog/2022-03-21) blog entry for an example on how to run a Project and see results.
3. Talk to us: Yes! You can actually T-A-L-K to us. We are not an anonymous website, but a company with real people. And we love talking to you. Send us an email
   to [support@layline.io](mailto:support@layline.io) and simply let us know when would be a good time to reach you and how.
